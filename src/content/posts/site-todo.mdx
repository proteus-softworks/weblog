- [ ] Pre-load fonts

Example from [fontsource](https://fontsource.org/docs/getting-started/preload)

```typescript
import '@fontsource-variable/open-sans';
import openSansWoff2 from '@fontsource-variable/open-sans/files/open-sans-latin-wght-normal.woff2?url';

<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" href={openSansWoff2} crossorigin="anonymous" />

```

- [ ] More fun facts
- [ ] Dynamic fun facts?
  
Not sure if really feasible, but maybe extract them into a yml/json/text file for easy mobile editing?

- [ ] Collage page with simple dynamic rendering of external images

I’m imagining like a table full of Polaroids?   

- [ ] Pic of me n beans on Home Screen
- [ ] Break out the “beliefs” sections into separate posts with a “belief” tag, reconstitute them into the beliefs post as a special type of post?
- [ ] Look into using [uniorg](https://github.com/rasendubi/uniorg) for live org-mode parsing
  - Once this happens, I can probably just move away from MDX and rely entirely on server-side org mode parsing
  - Publish a formal org-mode astro.js package?
  - Would maybe be nice for TODO stuff as well (like this doc)
