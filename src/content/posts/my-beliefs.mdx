#### Veganism is morally superior

Let me start by saying that I am (regrettably) not vegan — I don't eat animal flesh, but on occasion I will consume other animal products. I do, however, BELIEVE in veganism, and am slowly working to eliminate all animal exploitation from my life. Yes, the dissonance hurts. Yes, the animals hurt worse.

For many trying years (since ~2012) I was “vegetarian for the environment”, and SURPRISE it never really stuck — I would always regress after about 6 months, and try again in 8. It’s hard to care about the “environment” when you come face-to-face with the futility of your efforts. Which breeds the BIGGEST demon in the “green veggie” moral superiority complex: it is WAY TOO easy to say “Oh it’s just a little chicken, it’ll be thrown out otherwise” or “Gee what’s one burger gonna do? It’s local meat after all!” Blink again — you’re roasting a lamb over a spit (sadly, speaking from experience here).

Then, there was the “plant-based for health” era (less of an “era” and more of a “my doctor told me to do it to lower my cholesterol” type beat). I ate nothing but plants for 6 months, it wasn’t too difficult, and then it…actually worked. Much to my surprise. My cholesterol levels were in the normal range for the first time since I was at least 5 years old. Aaaaaaaand then the “in moderation” demon struck again, I blinked again and this time found myself roasting a pig.

Then I got cats.

#### You don't actually like capitalism

You don't even know what it means.

#### Paper is better

And this is why I created [poof](https://poof.proteus.works).

#### Tailwind is good

The fact that people defend the esoteric idea of separating styles and markup always baffles me. Like yeah, you don’t want to send a massive dump of crap in 1998, and CSS is a nice enough way to extract out a design system yet keep things small. But come on its `$CURRENT_YEAR`. IMO DiasyUI is basically the logical conclusion of how far you can take a CSS design system, while being as ergonomic as possible. But it is what is: a hack. And if you want to extend every possible minor variation as it’s own semantic variant class defined in some god-forsaken stylesheet, please go for it. But I will be using utility classes bc it’s the closest thing we have to sanity in web styling.

And yes you could make a number of small classes by yourself to augment these one-offs. But what do you get when you keep pushing down that road? A worse version of tailwind that you had to make yourself bc you’re too stubborn to just use it.

If an analogue to the `style` attribute was created that was as performant and extensible as CSS, and there was a bombproof implementation of properly composable markup tags to replace what we could consider a “class”, I have no doubt it would be lauded as a great improvement. Like it or not, CSS-in-JS is popular for a reason, despite the fact that it is a MASSIVE hack and very complex.

#### Emacs isn’t better than vim

I am typing this in Emacs. I love Emacs. I live in Emacs. I’ve been hacking on Emacs for nearly 15 years. And still: vim is just as good. So is Zed. So is VSCode (ethics aside…). Sure it would probably be prudent to “learn your tool” or whatever, but if you’re a hotshot programmer pigeon typing in Notepad++ then do your thing. Use what you like, not everybody wants to paint the bike-shed.

HOWEVER, if you have zero opinions on our trade — a favorite editor, library preferences, little tricks you swear by, functional or OOP, whatever — I probably won’t work with you.
